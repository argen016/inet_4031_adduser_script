# PHP Crude CRUD

## Description
This repository contains a simple three-tier data-driven web application. It was part of a class project to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using PHP and MySQL.

## What I Did
- Set up a virtual machine running Ubuntu.
- Installed and configured LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
- Created a sample database schema with 300,000 records.
- Built PHP scripts for database operations.
- Packaged the application into a `.tar.gz` file for deployment.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Deploy to a LAMP server environment.
3. Configure database credentials in `config.php`.
4. Open in a web browser to interact with the app.
